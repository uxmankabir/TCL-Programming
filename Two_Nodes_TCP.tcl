#This program will create two nodes and pass traffice from one node to other node using TCP protocol

#Creating simulator object 
set ns [new Simulator]   

#Creating the nam file
set nf [open out.nam w]      
#It opens the file 'out.nam' for writing and gives it the file handle 'nf'. 
$ns namtrace-all $nf

# Open the trace file
#  set nf [open out.tr w]
#  $ns trace-all $nf

#    we are opening a newtrace file named as "out" and also telling that data must be stored in .tr [trace] format.
#   "nf" is the file handler that we are used here to handle the trace file.
#   "w" means write i.e the file out.tr is opened for writing.
#   "r" means reading 
#   The second line tells the simulator to trace each packet on every link in the topology and for that we give file handler nf for the simulator ns.
